This program is to find the time difference for getRestaurant function and getRestaurantFast function to get all restaurant information stored in SD card.
And the display the recent run time and average run time. You can select which function to run by touching the button labeled "SLOW" or "FAST"  on the screen.
Some functions are from the stuff on eclass
